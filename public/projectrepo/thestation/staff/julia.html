    <div class="bio">
            <p>Julia is one of the first stylists in Colorado to have trained at Devachan in New York City and specializes in curly hair. She is a local educator for Deva Curl and recently became a Curl Architect, completing their 3 day class in Manhattan. She is a creative and attentive hairstylist known to create beautiful Schwarzkopf color, and prides herself in staying up-to-date on the most current cuts and styles through continuing education in the industry. She loves the daily opportunity to make people look and feel their best. Julia has been licensed in the industry since 2001 but started her hairstyling career many years before styling hair for many local theatre productions. In her spare time, Julia loves to do 50&#39;s inspired hairstyles, enjoys theatre, art, and jogging with her two dogs in Wash Park.</p>
