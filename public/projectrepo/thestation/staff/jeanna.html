    <h4>Jeanna</h4>

    <div class="bio">
            <p>Jeanna grew up in Castle Rock, Colorado. She is proud to call Denver her home, but enjoys traveling as much as possible. The ability to do that in her field of work made hair styling an easy career choice.</p>
            <p>Jeanna began her career in early 2008, studying at the Aveda Institute of Denver. She began specializing in naturally curly hair in early 2009, training with Deva Curl in New York, as well as extensive classes here in Denver. She has since branched out with other lines such as Moroccan Oil, expanding her curl knowledge. Jeanna has extensive training with Schwarzkopf color, having had hands-on education with many of the Schwarzkopf educators. Her professional drive has led her to study with cutting specialist Kathy Simon, color specialist Misael Aponte, and other companies such as Global Keratin, Lazio, and Surface.</p>
            <p>Hair is her passion, and Jeanna takes pride in making sure each unique person in her chair can be given the look they desire.</p>
